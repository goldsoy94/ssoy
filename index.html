<h1>THE PINK FAIRY BOOK
  <br>SNOWFLAKE</h1>
<p>Once upon a time there lived a peasant called Ivan, and he had a wife whose name was Marie. They would have been quite happy except for one thing: they had no children to play with, and as they were now old people they did not find that watching the children of their neighbours at all made up to them for having one of their own.</p>
<p>One winter, which nobody living will ever forget, the snow lay so deep that it came up to the knees of even the tallest man. When it had all fallen, and the sun was shining again, the children ran out into the street to play, and the old man and his wife sat at their window and gazed at them. The children first made a sort of little terrace, and stamped it hard and firm, and then they began to make a snow woman. Ivan and Marie watched them, the while thinking about many things.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ivan's face brightened, and, looking at his wife, he said, 'Wife, why shouldn't we make a snow woman too?'
'Why not?' replied Marie, who happened to be in a very good temper; 'it might amuse us a little. But there is no use making a woman. Let us make a little snow child, and pretend it is a living one.'</p>
<blockquote>'Yes, let us do that,' said Ivan, and he took down his cap and went into the garden with his old wife.</blockquote>
<p>Then the two set to work with all their might to make a doll out of the snow. They shaped a little body and two little hands and two little feet. On top of all they placed a ball of snow, out of which the head was to be.</p>
<p>'What in the world are you doing?' asked a passer-by.
<br>'Can't you guess?' returned Ivan.
<br>'Making a snow-child,' replied Marie.
</p>
<p>They had finished the nose and the chin. Two holes were left for the eyes, and Ivan carefully shaped out the mouth. No sooner had he done so than he felt a warm breath upon his cheek. He started back in surprise and lookedâ€”and behold! the eyes of the child met his, and its lips, which were as red as raspberries, smiled at him!</p>
